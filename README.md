# FastStart
This mod alternates your starting inventory (10 copper and iron bars) to something else. 3 options right now.
It is not like super balanced but i don't think that **enough** is somehow OP. Huge is huge, thats why it called huge.
##### few 
Gives a very few machines to reduce this manual stage a bit.
##### enough
Gives enough to don't dig and craft things manual, to build a small mall which will replicate more things.
##### huge
Huge is huge. A lot of basic things, a dozen of wireless power towers (WPT) and couple of thermal power stations (TPS) to have no problems with energy. **You can't build unopened things via menu at the bottom, to build them take them from inventory.**
### Details
| Buildings | Few | Enough | Huge |
| --------- | --: | -----: | ---: |
| Tesla Tower | 10 | 50 | 200 |
| Wind Turbine | 6 | 30 | 30 |
| Miner | 2 | 14 | 30 |
| Smelter | 3 | 24 | 50 |
| Belt | 100 | 600 | 900 |
| Sorter | 15 | 100 | 400 |
| Storage | 1 | 6 | 30 |
| Splitter  | - | 10 | 50 |
| Assembler | 3 | 20 | 50 |
| Matrix Lab | - | 8 | 20 |
| WPT | - | - | 20 |
| TPS | - | - | 8 |

Every option also has 30 magnetic coils, 30 circuit boards and 10 gears for first upgrades to skip manual digging/crafting and open basic building tools.
Researching starting techs rewards you with buildings, so for **few** its more likely 3 miners, 4 smelters and a couple more belts&sorters.
