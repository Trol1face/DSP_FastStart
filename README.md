# FastStart

This mod alternates your starting inventory (10 copper and iron bars) to something else. 3 options right now.  
It is not like super balanced but i don't think that **enough** is somehow OP. Huge is huge, thats why it called huge.

#### few 

Gives a very few machines to reduce this manual stage a bit.

#### enough

Gives enough to don't dig and craft things manual, to build a small mall which will replicate more things.

![enough](/Extra/enough.png)

#### huge

Huge is huge. A lot of basic things, a dozen of wireless power towers (WPT) and couple of thermal power stations (TPS) to have no problems with energy. **You can't build unopened things via menu at the bottom, to build them take them from inventory.**

![huge](/Extra/huge.png)

Every option has 30 magnetic coils, 30 circuit boards and 10 gears for early techs to skip manual digging/crafting and open basic building tools.

Researching early techs rewards you with buildings, so for **few** its more likely 3 miners, 4 smelters and a couple more belts&sorters.
