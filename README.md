# FastStart

This mod changes space capsule loot and early tech rewards to skip manual digging/crafting stage. 3 options right now.  

In every option space capsule drops enough materials to research electromagnetism, logistics, smelting, assembly and matrixlab.

There are 2 options in config:

- first will give blue matrixes for fast first drones speed+count research if you don't like their starting speed. *Personally i don't.*
- second will reward you with 2 ILS and 6 vessels for completing Interplanetary Logistics research, so you won't fly back and forth a couple times to setup first ILS;

### Detailed rewards (IMPORTANT: every building is a reward for corresponding tech research)

#### 'few' option

Gives a little more than default rewards.
